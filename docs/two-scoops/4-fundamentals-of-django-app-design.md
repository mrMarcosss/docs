# If an app seems too complex, it should be broken up into smaller apps.
> If an `app` can’t be explained in a single
sentence of moderate length, or you need to say ‘**and**’ more than once, it probably means **the app is too big** and should be broken up.

> “The art of creating and maintaining a good Django app is that it should follow the
truncated Unix philosophy according to Douglas McIlroy: ‘**Write programs that do one
thing and do it well**.”’
James Bennett (Django core developer)
